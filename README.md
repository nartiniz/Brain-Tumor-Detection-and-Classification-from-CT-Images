# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-from-CT-Images
A mask-rcnn model implemented in order to find tumors and classify them in CT images. 

For this project all other files are provided pytorch except my main.py file, which is combining all them together. 
Please note that main.py file shows how to implement a Mask-RCNN model and the real data is not provided here. In order to run the code you should have BrainTumor/AllImagesMatFiles,AllMasksMatFiles,AllLabelsMatFilesAllImagesMatFilesTest files.

If you would like to run the code with the real data, feel free to contact me.
